# Game_of_Life
This is a python program using Turtle Module which runs Conway's game of life.
Life is a cellular automaton or a model which simulates the evolution of cells.
Since it is a zero-player game, the initial state of a cell determines its evolution.

## How it works?
- A 2D grid was created, each squares represent a living or dead cell depending on its colour and state.
- At the start each cells are dead, user must select cells in which he wants to switch to a living state.
- Press Enter to run the simulation.

## Rules
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
