# Game_of_Life
This is a python program using Tkinter which creates a GUI which runs Conway's game of life
**How it works?**
- A n x n 2D grid was created, each squares represent a living or dead cell depending on its colour
- At the start each cells are dead so user must select cells in which he wants to switch to a living state.รง
- Press Enter to run the simulation.
- **Rules**
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
